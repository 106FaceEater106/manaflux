> Support for Polish and Portuguese brazilian has been added ! It's automatic: ManaFlux will use your system to know what language it's supposed to load.

## Key Features
- Automatic Runes, Item Sets, and Summoner Spells downloading
- Ability to change positions (roles, e.g MIDDLE, TOP) using the User Interface or the shortcuts
<kbd>Alt+Left Arrow</kbd> or <kbd>Alt+Right Arrow</kbd>
- You can hide it automatically in taskbar when you're not in champion select
- Instead of controlling your mouse to setup your runes, ManaFlux injects them directly in the client, so you don't have to do anything but pick your champion.
- Optimized network requests!

## Will I get banned if I use this ?
> Nope. As stated by a Rioter named RiotSargonas [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/80d4r0/runebook_the_ultimate_rune_pages_manager_that_you/duv2r22), things that interact with the desktop client (not the game) will never get you banned.

### Built with
- [Electron](https://electronjs.org/)
- [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org)
- Web Technologies: HTML5, CSS3 and JavaScript for rendering
- Theme inspired from League of Legends
- [LeaguePlug](https://github.com/Ryzzzen/leagueplug), Simplifies the connection to League of Legends client

#### Credits
Thanks to my friends who gave me the idea of making this software, without them this would've not existed!
