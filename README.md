> There's only one language for now. It's some kind of french and english.. I know I messed up. In a next update it will be fixed.

## Getting Started

#### Windows
 > Download the last .exe file in the releases tab, and execute it. That's all !
 The software will be installed on your computer then launched.

#### Mac OS X and Linux
 > You'll need to clone and build it by yourself: `npm install && electron .`


## Will I get banned if I use this ?
> Nope. As stated by a Rioter named RiotSargonas [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/80d4r0/runebook_the_ultimate_rune_pages_manager_that_you/duv2r22), things that interact with the desktop client (not the game) will never get you banned.
